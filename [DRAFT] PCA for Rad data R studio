  ##ADEGENET#


For adegenet the easiest might be to read the file in from structure format. - convert using pdgspider. 
#download http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/#Download_and_Installation_Instructions #
file <- read.structure("finalname.final.recode.str")
- then need to answer the questions: 63 individuals, 5802 loci. 

Which column contains labels for genotypes ('0' if absent)? 1

 Which column contains the population factor ('0' if absent)? 2

 Which other optional columns should be read (press 'return' when done)? 1: 

 Which row contains the marker names ('0' if absent)? 1

 Are genotypes coded by a single row (y/n)? n

 Converting data from a STRUCTURE .stru file to a genind object..
 
 
 birds <- read.structure("/Users/aminachabach/Project/finalname.final.recode.str")
 
 phepop <- genind2genpop(birds)
phepop

indNamesâ€ : returns/sets labels for individuals; only for genind.

head(indNames(file),10)
#nInd: returns the number of individuals in the object; only for genind. #DONT'T RUN OUR NAMES ARE FINE AS THEY ARE

indNames(birds) <- paste("cat", 1:nInd(birds),sep=".")
head(indNames(birds),10)

5.4 Measuring and testing population structure (a.k.a F statistics)

library(devtools)
install_github("jgx65/hierfstat")
#Haven't actually installed this, do we even need it bc the net line runs?

#Can we find any population structure in the pheasent colonies? The basic F statistics are provided by:

library("hierfstat")
fstat(birds)

 Gtest <- gstat.randtest(birds,nsim=99)
